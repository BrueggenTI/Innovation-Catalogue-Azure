 Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <button.btn btn-outline-secondary#cancelResearchBtn>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <div.modal fade#deepResearchModal>
