EGIN PROMPT]

Act as a senior Product Innovation Strategist and UI/UX Designer.

Your task is to generate a detailed concept and a visual layout for a digital "Innovation Catalogue". This tool is for the B2B sales team of H. & J. Brüggen KG, a leading European private-label manufacturer of cereals, muesli, and cereal bars.

The tool will be used by sales representatives on a tablet during meetings with clients (e.g., retail buyers, product managers of supermarket chains) to facilitate collaborative and forward-looking discussions.

The core objective is to create an interactive, visually engaging experience that achieves three main goals:

Showcase existing product formulations and capabilities with concrete examples.

Inspire clients by presenting current and future market trends.

Capture client-specific needs, ideas, and potential new product configurations in real-time.

Please design the concept with the following three key modules:

Module 1: "Our Competence" - The Core Portfolio Explorer

This module provides a dynamic overview of Brüggen's proven products and manufacturing capabilities. It should be more than a static list.

Functionality:

A searchable and filterable database of base recipes (e.g., crunchy muesli, porridge, baked granola, various cereal bars).

Filters should include: product category, key ingredients (oats, spelt, quinoa), nutritional claims (high-protein, high-fiber, low-sugar, organic, gluten-free), and production technologies.

For each product, show high-quality images/videos, a list of key ingredients, available certifications, and a short "case study" example of how a similar product was successfully launched with another client (anonymized if necessary).

Visualization: A clean, grid-based layout with high-quality visuals. Clicking on a product opens a detailed "fact sheet" overlay.

Module 2: "The Future of Breakfast" - Trends & Insights Hub

This module acts as a conversation starter, positioning Brüggen as an innovation partner. It should present trends in a digestible, infographic style.

Functionality:

Dedicated sections for key consumer trends:

Health & Wellness: (e.g., functional ingredients like probiotics, adaptogens; protein fortification; sugar reduction).

Sustainability: (e.g., sourcing stories, new sustainable packaging options, upcycled ingredients).

Flavor & Texture Innovation: (e.g., emerging flavor pairings, new texture experiences like ultra-crunchy clusters or soft-baked bars).

Each trend should be backed by short market data points, consumer insights, and conceptual product images that bring the trend to life.

Visualization: A visually rich, interactive section. Think of it like a digital magazine or a Prezi-style presentation where the sales rep can zoom into different trend areas.

Module 3: "The Co-Creation Lab" - Interactive Product Builder

This is the most critical, interactive module. It allows the sales rep and the client to build a new product concept together during the meeting.

Functionality:

A step-by-step guided process:

Choose a Base: Select a base recipe from Module 1 (e.g., "Crunchy Oat Granola").

Add & Refine Ingredients: A drag-and-drop interface to add or substitute ingredients (e.g., add freeze-dried raspberries, pecans, chocolate chunks). The system should flag potential conflicts or cost implications.

Select Claims & Certifications: Choose from a list of available nutritional claims or certifications (e.g., "Organic", "High-Fiber").

Configure Packaging: Select from different packaging types (e.g., stand-up pouch, box, single-serve pot) and show mock-ups.

As the product is built, a "live" mock-up of the product/packaging visually updates.

A running summary of the configuration (ingredients, claims, packaging) is always visible.

Output: At the end of the process, the tool must be able to generate a "Concept Summary PDF" that includes the visual mock-up and all specifications. This PDF can be emailed directly to the client from the app. This is the primary function for "collecting customer wishes."

Overall UI/UX and Visual Design:

Interface: Design a clean, premium, and modern dashboard-style interface. It should be intuitive for a touch-based tablet. The main screen could feature prominent entry points to the three modules.

Branding: The design should reflect Brüggen's corporate identity but with a modern, innovative twist.

User Flow: A typical user flow would be:

Sales rep opens the app and briefly presents trends from Module 2 to inspire the client.

Based on the client's interest, they explore related base products in Module 1.

They then move to Module 3 to customize a selected base product according to the client's specific wishes.

The session concludes with generating and sending the PDF summary.

Requested Output:

Please provide a detailed description of this concept, outlining the user flow and the features of each module. Accompany this with a description of the visual layout and key screens, as if you were describing a wireframe or mock-up to a development team.
